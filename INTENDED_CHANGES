INTENDED CHANGES:

High Priority:
 - sync location in song between clients and server (WIP)

Medium Priority:
 - volume is super low at lower settings (make volume logarithmic)
 - get rid of hard coded connection to predetermined server location and port
 - use different threads for sending to different clients
 - only send the next ~3 songs to clients instead of sending every single song as it's received


Low Priority:
 - move console to client window (replacing SENDING field)
 - more audio types
